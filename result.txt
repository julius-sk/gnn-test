AIA-SpGEMM Performance Analysis: Comparing Against Two Baselines
I'll analyze the performance of hash-based SpGEMM with AIA by comparing it to two key baselines:
1.	Baseline 1: cuSPARSE
2.	Baseline 2: Hash-based SpGEMM without AIA
Data Analysis for SpGEMM Operations
First, let's organize the performance data for each matrix:
Matrix	With AIA (ms)	Without AIA (ms)	cuSPARSE (ms)	AIA vs No-AIA	AIA vs cuSPARSE
amazon	8.641127	11.66019	37.05754	25.89%	76.68%

Average SpGEMM Improvement:
•	AIA vs No-AIA: 12.53% faster
•	AIA vs cuSPARSE: 77.27% faster
Impact on GNN Training Time
Now let's analyze how these SpGEMM improvements translate to overall GNN training time for the Flickr GraphSAGE example:
Flickr GraphSAGE Original Performance:
•	Forward Pass: 26.012ms (using cuSPARSE)
•	Backward Pass: 11.681ms
•	Total per epoch: 37.692ms
Flickr GraphSAGE with MaxK-GNN kernels (spgemm+sspmm): 
•	Forward Pass: 19.101ms
•	Backward Pass: 6.362ms
•	Total per epoch: 25.463ms
Estimating Hash-based SpGEMM without AIA:
Based on our data, hash-based SpGEMM without AIA is about 73.78% faster than cuSPARSE on average:
•	Estimated Forward Pass: 26.012ms * (1 - 0.7378) = 6.82ms
•	Backward Pass: 11.681ms
•	Total per epoch: 18.50ms
Estimating Hash-based SpGEMM with AIA:
•	Forward Pass: 6.82ms * (1 - 0.1253) = 5.97ms (applying 12.53% improvement from AIA)
•	Backward Pass: 11.681ms
•	Total per epoch: 17.65ms

AIA-SpGEMM Performance with FPGA Optimization Analysis
Matrix	Gathering Time (GA) (ms)	Execution Time (EX) (ms)	Total (2*GA+EX) (ms)	2GA/(2GA+EX) Ratio
amazon	0.932353	10.15685	12.021556	0.155 (15.5%)
webgoogle	1.339905	18.92311	21.60292	0.124 (12.4%)
scircuit	1.036799	2.763061	4.836659	0.429 (42.9%)
cit-Patents	2.712575	43.38351	48.80866	0.111 (11.1%)
p2p-Gnutella04	0.064	0.90153	1.02953	0.124 (12.4%)
econ	0.244224	5.15133	5.639778	0.087 (8.7%)
Average 2GA/(2GA+EX) Ratio: 0.172 (or 17.2% of total execution time)
This means that on average, the AIA gathering phase (performed twice) constitutes about 17.2% of the total operation time in the current implementation.
Projected Improvements with Faster FPGA AIA
Scenario 1: FPGA AIA Twice as Fast (2×)
If we make the FPGA AIA gathering phase twice as fast, the contribution of AIA would be halved:

Average hash base SpGeMM  Improvement with 2× Faster AIA: 8.58%
Scenario 2: FPGA AIA Four Times as Fast (4×)
If we make the FPGA AIA gathering phase four times as fast:
Matrix	Original AIA%	AIA% after 4×	Original Total (ms)	New Total (ms)	Improvement %
amazon	15.5%	3.88%	12.021556	10.623027	11.63%

econ	8.7%	2.18%	5.639778	5.273442	6.50%
Average hash base SpGeMM Improvement with 4× Faster AIA: 12.87%
Performance Analysis with Three Clear Baselines and AIA-SpGEMM Variants
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll restructure the comparison to include three distinct baselines:
1.	Baseline 1: cuSPARSE spmm(forward) + spmm(backward) (both from dgl cusparse library)
2.	Baseline 2: MaxK-GNN with SPGEMM (forward)+SSPMM(backward) (both from maxkgnn paper)
3.	Baseline 3: Hash-based SpGEMM without AIA (forward)+spmm(backward)
And then compare the AIA-SpGEMM variants against these baselines.

Key Insights from Three-Baseline Comparison
1.	Baseline Comparison: 
o	Baseline 3 (Hash without AIA) already provides substantial improvement over both cuSPARSE (50.9%) and MaxK-GNN (27.4%)
o	This indicates the hash-based SpGEMM algorithm itself provides most of the performance gain
2.	AIA Contribution: 
o	AIA adds an incremental but meaningful improvement (4.6%) over Baseline 3
o	FPGA acceleration of AIA further enhances this advantage (up to 8.8% with 4× FPGA)
3.	Hybrid Approach Benefits: 
o	Combining AIA with MaxK-GNN's backward pass provides the most dramatic improvement
o	This hybrid approach outperforms all baselines by wide margins
o	Even compared to the already-fast Baseline 3, the hybrid offers 33.4-37.5% improvement
4.	Diminishing Returns Analysis: 
o	FPGA acceleration of AIA provides diminishing returns (additional 2.8-4.2% over standard AIA)
o	However, the backward pass optimization provides much larger gains (28.8% improvement)
o	This suggests focusing on backward pass optimization might be more beneficial than further forward pass optimization
Implementation conclusion and future work
Based on this clear three-baseline comparison:
1.	For Immediate Performance Gains: 
o	Hash-based SpGEMM without AIA (Baseline 3) as a starting point
o	This already provides substantial performance over standard libraries (50.9% vs cuSPARSE)
2.	For Enhanced Performance: 
o	Add AIA optimization to the hash-based SpGEMM
o	This provides additional 4.6% improvement with minimal implementation complexity
3.	For Maximum Performance: 
o	Implement the hybrid approach (AIA forward + MaxK-GNN backward)
o	This provides dramatic improvements over all baselines (33.4-69.3% depending on baseline)
o	Even with standard AIA (no FPGA acceleration), this hybrid approach delivers exceptional results
4.	For Specific Graph Types: 
o	For graphs like scircuit where AIA plays a larger role, prioritize AIA optimization
o	For general-purpose use, focus more on backward pass optimization
